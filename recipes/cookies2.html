    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in cocoa and baking powder. Beat for 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in flour by hand. Mix in white chocolate and chocolate chips. Cover dough, and chill for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Divide dough into two parts, and roll each part into a 9 inch long log. Place logs on lightly greased cookie sheet, about 4 inches apart. Flatten slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool for one hour.</li>
        <li>Cut each loaf into 1/2 inch wide diagonal slices. Place slices on an ungreased cookie sheet, and bake at 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C) for 9 minutes. Turn cookies over, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes. Cool completely, then store in an airtight container.</li>
